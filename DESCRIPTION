Description: Clonogenic survival is a key characteristic of growing cells. 
    The colony formation assay (CFA) quantifies the clonogenic potential of 
    cells after treatment with ionizing radiation or chemical agents.
        It has been reported, that cell density effects (cooperativity) disturb 
    the conventionally estimated clonogenic survival (Brix et al., Radiation 
    Oncology, 2020). A new method to estimate the clonogenic survival more 
    robustly against cooperativity effects presented in Brix et al. is 
    implemented in this package.
