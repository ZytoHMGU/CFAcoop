Description: The CFAcoop package provides functions that enable a robust 
    analysis of colony formation assay (CFA) data in presence or absence 
    of cellular cooperation. The implemented method has been described 
    in Brix et al., Radiat. Oncol., (2020) 
    "The clonogenic assay: robustness of plating efficiency-based analysis
    is strongly compromised by cellular cooperation"
        Power regression for parameter estimation, calculation of survival
    fractions, uncertainty analysis and plotting functions are provided.
